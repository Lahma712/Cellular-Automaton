# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

This is my Python implementation of the famous "Conway's Game of Life", which was invented by the english mathematician <b>John Horton Conway</b> in 1970.
The game plays out on a 2D plane and is based on a 2D cellular automaton (see automata theory by <b>Stanislaw Marcin Ulam</b>). I implemented the GUI using Kivy 2.0.0
and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

<b>How to use: </b>

Execute the <b>Main.py</b> file.

Draw a shape on the plane by clicking and moving the mouse cursor.

To erase a drawn cell, click on it again.

To start the automaton, click on the "Start" button (you can also pause by clicking on it again).

To zoom in/out, click on the "zoom in"/"zoom out" buttons.

To erase everything, click on the "clear" button.
